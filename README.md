# Statistical Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of foundational algorithms from the Statistical Machine Learning course at IIIT-Delhi. All models are built using only NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib — no high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow are used.

## 📁 Contents

### 🧮 Assignment 1: MNIST Classification using PCA, FDA, LDA, and QDA
- Performed classification on MNIST digits 0, 1, and 2.
- Estimated Gaussian parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher’s Discriminant Analysis (FDA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Implemented Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) from scratch.

### 🌲 Assignment 2: Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest with 5-Fold Cross-Validation
- Implemented a custom decision tree for regression using Gini impurity.
- Extended the tree with ensemble methods: Bagging and Random Forest.
- Designed and implemented 5-fold cross-validation from scratch to evaluate model performance and generalization.

### 🚀 Assignment 3: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network for Binary Classification
- Built AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting models using decision stumps as weak learners.
- Implemented a feedforward neural network with backpropagation from scratch.
- Trained the neural network on synthetic binary classification data.
